# SuperliminalTools

A BepInEx plugin for Superliminal for speedrun practice and tool assisted speedrunning.

## Installation

## Usage

Use the included `.bat` files to launch the game in practice mod, TAS mod, or with no mods.

When run manually, the plugin loads practice mod. Use `--tas` as a launch argument to start TAS mod.
